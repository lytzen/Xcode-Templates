# Xcode-Templates
My Xcode Templates

Got a bit tired of writing the same boiler plate, so I started this repo, as many have done before me. For now there is only one template, but I suspect more will follow...

# Installation

Simply copy the repo into:
```
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/
```

Or make a symlink from your git repo checkout point (that is what I always do):
```
cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates
ln -s <your git repo checkout point>/Xcode-Templates/File\ Template/Custom
```

This will add a "Custom" group under iOS:

Don't like the name "Custom"? You can just change it to something else, or loose it entirely.
